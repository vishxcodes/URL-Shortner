# URL Shortener
This is a URL-Shortner made using NodeJS and ExpressJS.
This is my first NodeJS project which focuses completely on the backend and not the front-end.
# WORKING
User can input any URL and a NEW, UNIQUE AND SHORT URL will be provided to the user.
Also the details of previous URLs converted by the user is available to him.
